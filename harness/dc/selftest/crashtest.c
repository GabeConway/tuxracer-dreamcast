/* Deliberately crashing guest program. Used to prove the harness fail path:
 * it must exit non-zero, must NOT hang until the timeout, and must capture the
 * whole KOS "Unhandled exception" register dump into the console log so that
 * sh-elf-addr2line can symbolise the faulting PC on the host.
 *
 * NOTE (verified, see kb/design-harness.md §6): Flycast does NOT trap unaligned
 * accesses or writes to address 0, under either the dynarec or the interpreter.
 * An illegal instruction is the only reliable crash canary here.
 *
 * NOTE 2 (verified 2026-08-01, KOS 2.3.0 + Flycast v2.6): NEVER call
 * scif_flush() from guest code. KOS's scif_flush() clears TEND and then spins
 * waiting for it to come back; Flycast never re-raises TEND on an already-idle
 * TX FIFO, so the spin times out and KOS latches `serial_enabled = 0` --
 * silently killing ALL further serial output, including the panic register
 * dump. A crash after an explicit scif_flush() is invisible to the harness and
 * shows up only as a wall-clock timeout. printf()/scif_write_buffer() flush on
 * their own; you never need the explicit call.
